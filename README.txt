This project will include my new game Nonogram (some time it is also named Japaness Crossword).
You can read detailed rules for original game at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram

I have modified rules a bit to make it playable for multiple players ower the network.

I will use C++ programming language and Windows as a target platform.
